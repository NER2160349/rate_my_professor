        "Love hawwwrrrr!!!!",
        "She's one of the best professors I've had so far. Her class was fun. She's also the director of admissions. She's really clear on what she wants you to do. She's a really nice teacher. Loves to discuss in class. Does a lot of peer review work in class. No tests. Overall great class",
        "Lisa Kasper is a gem. She is the best teacher I've had at MSU so far. She loves what she does and is good at constructively helping students. Take her if you can!",
        "I thought she was amazing. Probably the best English instructor Montclair State has to offer. Was extremely lucky to be placed in her class.",
        "Do the homework and READ before you go to class. She is a very nice professor unless you don't put your part. She is very fair and clear about the assignments, makes you do like almost 10 reading reactions, and the essays. It's worth it, she's awesome.",
        "for my class she did 9 reading reactions 10 points each, she counts attendance and class participation, and she does 4 essays. She is so passionate in english, what you learn in class will actually help you in class and she is hysterical. love her she made me more interested in english.",
        "Awesome teacher, she keeps you interested in the class. You have about 10 reading reactions and 4 essays. She drops your lowest reading reaction. Def take her if you can.",
        "Kasper makes you read and write a lot of reading reactions about 8 throughout the semester. 5 papers, 8 reading reactions (1-2pgs) 1 documentated essay.. portfolio. attendance. Her class was pretty interesting especially what she made us read.. shes a tough grader tho.",
        "I've know Professor Kasper for some time and I have to tell you... She is without a doubt the hardest working Professor and the the hardest worker on the professional staff as well. I can't think of anyone who cares more about MSU, and the students, more than Lisa Kasper!",
        "nice professor but waaaaaay to much homework, I've never written so many papers in my life, not even even in 400 level classes.",
