        "Downright terrible, no clue how they're a professor for any institution should revoke their teaching license immediately",
        "Terrible teacher and very rude honestly its absurd how this professor is still teaching. Honest to God a terrible experience speaking with them just so rude and snarky and they think they're above everybody 0/10 IF THIS IS YOUR PROFESSOR DROP THAT CLASS IMMEDIATLY",
        "He mocked me for failing my first test and then called me out for not attending his office hours. I went to every office hour after that and still didn't manage to make it out with a C. I don't understand why he teaches when he seems miserable doing it. Take it at a county college is my best advise!",
        "I kid you not this professor should be reviewed by the university he is incompetent and isn't a great professor. I had to retake this course because 1 he is an awful teacher, just reads off the slides and his quizzes are nothing like the homework or things we go over in class.  WOULD NOT RECOMMEND STAY CLEAR AND DO NOT TAKE HIS CLASS FOR ANYTHING",
        "Discrete is a hard class from what I understand, and he does not make it any more interesting. If you're going to take this professor, study a lot and study hard on your own. On the final, he put things that he did not even mention he would put on there, luckily I still passed the class though.",
        "This guy is absolutely awful at his job. He reads slides, always makes excuses about why he isnt grading, and says he doesnt curve but he has to because he will lose his job if he doesnt. Read on your own.\n\nAnyways, the answer to his assignments are on github. I can't link so figure it out: \ngaurangsaini/sipser-computation-3rd-solutions",
        "The worst \"teacher\" in the department. When asked what would be on the final, he was purposefully vague and seemed to take pleasure in his students being lost and confused. The fact that every exam had a failing average is testament to this. This man is pure evil and an embarrassment to teaching and CS. The fact that I paid for this is insulting.",
        "The complexity is already immense but just talking and reading the slides along with the unexplained jargon used is very hard to follow. Could use more visual representations. Exams hold virtually no partial credit which led to low class averages. Self-study is required regardless, but could have been shortened with higher lecture clarity to pass.",
        "Another terrible professor that needs to be investigated by the University for his rude behavior. He made me feel as if I was worth nothing when I was a brand new transfer student looking to major in IT. He basically told me I wasn't good enough to finish in 2 years and that I should just quit. Please Montclair, please look at these reviews.",
        "I struggled with the coding part of this course so I decided I'd just fail and retake it later... Coutras reached out and offered to give me more time to make up my grade. When I didn't respond within his expected timeframe he was INCREDIBLY rude to me. After our exchange I emailed the dean about his behavior and he was even rude to me about that.",
        "Prof Coutras comes off as kind at first but truly doesn't care about having his students succeed. He teaches as if everyone knows what he's talking about from the get-go. I was not a CS major and I struggled a lot. If it wasn't for my classmates I really would've done poorly. Even if you reach out to him he may ignore you or fail to help.",
        "Where should I start?! This course is asynchronous and online so that means he won't teach you. He hardly responds to emails in a timely fashion. He is not specific with his directions. He is awful. He isn't as bad as other reviews say he is, but you have to teach yourself. Put in the work and you can get an A. It took me 4 weeks to do this.",
        "I'm taking this class right now and this professor sucks. He's passive-aggressive and doesn't give very clear instructions but of course, it will be your fault if you make a mistake because you didn't understand the instructions. And the class is a total joke. You'll have to do pointless things like watch videos that are just ads for tech-startups.",
        "In a Programming class, he just comes in talks of slides and assigns homework. He grades the HW at the end of the semester and in terms of weight they are worthless. Being it a basic programming class we hadn't written a single piece of code in class. He doesn't curve the grade either In short, if you want to learn to code AVOID HIM.",
        "All he does is read the slides so if you want to learn programming dont take this class.",
        "Terrible guy. Highly don't recommend. Also makes you feel worthless.",
        "He takes shortcuts on lectures, sometimes the material doesn't even match up with the book which is going to be your go-to if you want to pass this class. I've taken 8 classes in the computer science department between high school and him and I've never had to question whether or not I was going to pass until now.",
        "This guy only reads off of the slides. Surprise slides are wrong. He actually tells you that. 90% of the grade is based off of the midterm/final. Tons of homework that basically means nothing for your grade. He doesn't grade it though, and you don't get comments if and when it gets returned to you. Stay an admin, don't teach ever again please",
        "I would like to second \"Who knew someone could be this terrible at their job.\" I also did not know this before meeting him. Absolutely horrible. Doesn't answer questions or even grade HW",
        "Have to purchase online book and all homework is accessible through there. Not super clear on instructions so it makes assignments a little harder than they should be and doesn't respond to emails that fast so if you're not ready to do the work for this class on your own, don't take it."
